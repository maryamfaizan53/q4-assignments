# 🧠 Prompt Testing Framework: Fundamental Prompting Techniques Summary Evaluation

| Prompt Version | Goal | Model | Temperature | Output Summary (≤60 words) | Output Quality | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| v1.0 | Baseline summary | GPT-4 | 0.3 | Fundamental prompting techniques include Zero-Shot, One-Shot, Few-Shot, System, Role, and Contextual Prompting. Each provides distinct guidance from direct task execution to context-based enhancement. | Good | Clear but slightly rigid; serves as baseline output. |
| v1.1 | Emphasize key differences | GPT-4.1 | 0.5 | Fundamental prompting techniques guide AI responses differently: Zero-Shot for simple queries, One/Few-Shot for pattern learning, System for context, Role for expertise, Contextual for background. | Better | Improved clarity; added comparative insight; tone slightly academic. |
| v1.2 | Precision-focused summary | GPT-4 | 0.7 | Six prompting strategies—Zero-Shot, One-Shot, Few-Shot, System, Role, and Contextual—enhance model adaptability by providing structure, examples, and context suited to task-specific needs. | Excellent | Highly precise and technical; best for expert readers. |
| v1.3 | Simplify for general readers | GPT-4-turbo | 0.7 | The blog explains six basic AI prompting types: Zero-, One-, and Few-Shot use examples to teach patterns; System sets rules; Role gives AI a job; Contextual offers background info for better task understanding. | Excellent | Simplified perfectly; clear and educational tone for beginners. |
| v1.4 | Broad overview | ChatGPT-4o-latest | 1.0 | Prompting guides AI behavior: Zero-, One-, and Few-Shot shape responses; Role gives personas; System sets behavior; Contextual adds info; Chain-of-Thought aids reasoning. Each method optimizes AI accuracy. | Very Good | Engaging and explanatory; slightly broad but well-structured. |
| v1.5 | Add insight element | GPT-4 | 0.5 | Fundamental Prompting Techniques outlines six strategies: Zero-, One-, Few-Shot, System, Role, and Contextual Prompting. Each refines model responses for tasks. Properly applied, these techniques enhance the performance and accuracy of Language Learning Models (LLMs). | Excellent | Balanced and professional; adds valuable insight; ideal for academic or report use. |

## 🔍 Observations

- Temperature effect: Lower temperatures (0.3–0.5) produced concise and consistent outputs, while higher (0.7–1.0) improved creativity and engagement but risked verbosity.
- Tone adjustment: Educational tones (v1.3) improved accessibility, while formal/technical tones (v1.2 & v1.5) conveyed expertise and precision.
- Model behavior: GPT-4 variants showed stable performance; GPT-4o added fluency and natural phrasing at higher temperatures.

## 🧾 Conclusion

Among all versions, v1.5 achieved the best balance between informativeness, clarity, and insight — suitable for both technical documentation and professional reports. Versions v1.2 and v1.3 are excellent for specialized and beginner audiences respectively. Overall, prompt structure, tone, and temperature directly impact clarity, detail level, and user comprehension.
